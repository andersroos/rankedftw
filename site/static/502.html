      Blizzard's data API has been super unstable for the last year or
      two, as the data can't be trusted there is no reason to keep
      this site running. There are
      alternatives, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft">starcraft
      reddit</a> is probably the best place to find them.

      If you want to contact me for any reason I will continue to read
      this <a itemprop="email" href="mailto:rankedftw.com@gmail.com"
      target="_top">email address</a> for a while.

      I had a bunch of fun building and maintaining this site for 10
      years (even if most of the time was spent on doing workarounds
      for problems with Blizzard's shit API). Thanks for all the nice
      feedback and the donations!
