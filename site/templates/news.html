    The latest news about the site.
  </p>

  <h2>MMR Part Tree (2016-12-11)</h2>
  <p>
    Ladder and statistics now contains all ranked races for teams that plays
    multiple races.
  </p>
  <p>
    Team page now have an option to filter by race or show best race.
  </p>

  <h2>MMR Part Two (2016-12-04)</h2>
  <p>
    The team graph and world/region/league rankings are now calculated with MMR
    where applicable. League backgrounds are disabled for mmr since league
    boundaries overlap by a lot.
  </p>
  <p>
    Next up is multiple mmrs per team in 1v1.
  </p>

  <h2>MMR Part One (2016-11-17)</h2>
  <p>
    Blizzard finally added MMR to the API. I have now added MMR to the ladder
    page, this is now the primary sort order for ladder ranks. I haven't decided
    if I will add league and points back as a sort order, I feel it is not very
    high on the prio list.
  </p>
  <p>
    Next up will be MMR for the team rank over time graph. Also I will try to
    update last season with MMR. This will have some nasty side effects since
    it is only possible to get the rankings from the season end. So unless I want to
    do some complicated mixing of how ranks are displayed/calculated I will
    have to scrap all data points but the last from season 28 and from season
    start until now for season 29. We will see. If you read this far and have
    an opinion now is the time to shout.
  </p>

  <h2>Changed sorting order of Grandmaster (2016-11-06)</h2>
  <p>
    The last two seasons Blizzard has sorted GM on MMR. That
    is the order it is received through the API (even though the actual
    MMR value is not in the API). GM is now shown as is from
    Blizzard (MMR order), rather than resorted using points as it was
    before.
  </p>
  <p>
    This have been updated for both season 28 and season 29.
  </p>
  <p>
    When calculating world rank the different GM leagues for the different
    regions will be interleaved. It will look a bit strange, but comparing
    regions is a strange thing to do, so I think it is fine.
  </p>

  <h2>Tier Issue Solved (2016-10-22)</h2>
  <p>
    Blizzard added a new API so it is now possible to get information
    on tiers. Ladder is now updated with tiers and rankings from last
    season have been fixed.
  </p>
  <p>
    Not possible to get tier data for SEA yet, so not fixed for SEA.
  </p>

  <h2>Handling of Ranking by Race (Separate Race MMR) (2016-10-18)</h2>
  <p>
    Separate MMR for different races was introduced this season
    (season 5 2016). For now this will be handled by only showing the
    best rank for each team. Rankings for the other races will be
    filtered out and not shown nor counted.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that the league stats will be skewed because of this, higher
    leagues will appear larger and lower smaller. Also this may cause
    grandmaster ladder on site to differ from the in game grandmaster
    ladder or other ranking sites.
  </p>
  <p>
    I will probably fix this in the future, maybe adding a filtering
    option for it. The reason for doing it like this first is because
    it is the simplest solution.
  </p>

  <h2>Broken Rankings Season 4 2016 (2016-07-28)</h2>
  <p>
    As a consequence of the Ladder Revamp where each ladder is now one
    of three tiers, ladder ranks on the site are no longer
    accurate. The tiers within a league are currently mixed up since
    tier information is not yet available in the Blizzard Battle Net
    API. This means that a tier-3 800 points master player will be
    displayed higher ranked than a tier-1 700 point master player.
  </p>
  <p>
    This applies to Season 4 2016 only, rankings before that are still
    correct. Grandmaster is still accurate since it does not have
    tiers. The statistics pages are also still accurate since it only
    uses league information and ranks within a league are irrelevant.
  </p>

  <h2>Added Clan Support (2016-04-24)</h2>
  <p>
    <a href="{% url "clan-overview" %}">Clan ladders are now available.</a> Clan ladders are limited to members
    ranked in the current season, 1v1 and LotV. At the moment I have no plans to add anything else please tell me if
    you don't agree with this.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am aware that linking to clans on the site is a bit lacking (for example can't click on clan tag in the regular
    ladder or in player search results). I will probably address this later (and there are other usability issues
    as well), but I have a few behind the scenes issues and bugs that I need to fix first.
  </p>

  <h2>More Frequent Updates (2016-03-10)</h2>
  <p>
    As of public request the ladder data now updates more frequently (this is the fast hack version, so don't expect
    to work flawlessly yet). Grandmaster (1v1 and Archon) will be updated approximately once a minute (then there is a delay of 1 - 2
    minutes before data appears on the site, this will be tuned later). 1v1 platinum to master will updated continuously but
    not more often than every 10 minutes, in practice this will mean every 10 - 20 minutes depending on the region and
    how fast the blizzard api responds at the moment. All other divisions will also be updated continuously but not more
    often than once an hour.
  </p>
  <p>
    There will also be a daily window of about 1 hour (around 08:00 UTC) where there will be no updates. This will
    hopefully be removed later. The plan is to also remove the window of no updates around season breaks (this is now
    5 days or so).
  </p>
  <p>
    This feature experimental so don't be surprised if updates are slower, the age of the data will be displayed in
    the ladder.
  </p>

  <h2>Support for Legacy of the Void (2015-11-24)</h2>
  <p>
    Legacy of the Void for all modes (including Archon mode) is now supported in ladder, stats and team history sections.
  </p>

  <h2>Current Ladder Sortable and Filterable (2015-08-30)</h2>
  <p>
    Added a <a href="{% url 'ladder' version='lotv' mode='1v1' sort_key='ladder-rank' reverse='' %}">section</a> for
    the current ladder standing. All versions and modes are supported along with various sorting options like
    ladder position, wins, losses etc. Filtering on race, region and league is also possible.
  </p>
  <p>

  <a href="{% url 'ladder' version='lotv' mode='1v1' sort_key='win-rate' reverse='-' %}?f=eu,random,diamond"><img src="{{ STATIC_URL }}img/samples/ladder.png"/></a>

  <h2>Stats and Rankings for All Team Games (2015-08-30)</h2>
  <p>
    Team game data have been fetched since the start of the site but never been on the actual site, now they are.
    Both <a href="{% url 'stats-leagues' 'team-4v4'%}">stats</a> and <a href="{%  url 'team' 350424 %}">rankings</a>
    are available.
  </p>

  <h2>Ads Replaced with Donation Link (2015-08-30)</h2>
  <p>
    Ads was added as an experiment about half a year ago. It turned out that the ads generated zero income for
    the site (only for the ad provider). There no reason to make the site ugly and give money to any possible
    ad providers so ads have been removed. However the site still costs money to run and it would be nice
    if the visitors of this site was willing to contribute to that, so a <a href="{% url 'donate' %}">donation link</a>
    was added. Donations are appreciated, not required.
  </p>

  <h2>Active Ranks Removed (2015-02-19)</h2>
  <p>
    The intention with the active rank was to have a more accurate
    estimate of skill progress, but it turns out it is not so I have
    removed it. I have a few ideas to replace it with something
    better soon&trade;.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Race Statistics Added (2014-09-01)</h2>
  <p>
    The third sc2 statistics page added. Race distribution among ranked
    1v1 players over time.
  </p>
  <a href="{% url 'stats-races' '1v1'%}"><img src="{{ STATIC_URL }}img/samples/race-stats.png"/></a>
  
  <h2>Population Statistics Added (2014-08-30)</h2>
  <p>
    <a href="{% url 'stats-population' '1v1'%}">The second statistics page
    added.</a> The number of ranked 1v1 players over time.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Ladder Distribution Statistics Added (2014-08-26)</h2>
  <p>
    As a bi-product of tracking sc2 ladder rankings for all players
    the statistics section was added, more statistics will come but
    the ladder distribution history is the first one out.
  </p>
  <a href="{% url 'stats-leagues' '1v1'%}"><img src="{{ STATIC_URL }}img/samples/league-distribution.png"/></a>
  
  <h2>Site Goes Live (2014-08-10)</h2>
  <p>
    The first version of the site goes live with 1v1 data
    accessible. Team history is the only feature available.
  </p>
  <a href="{% url 'search' %}"><img src="{{ STATIC_URL }}img/samples/team-ranking.png"/></a>
  
  <h2>Data Collection Starts (fall 2013)</h2>
  <p>
    Data collection of sc2 ladder for the site is started. Using the
    Blizzard Battle.net ladder API the current ladder standings are
    updated every day.
